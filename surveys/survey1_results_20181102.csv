I'm fond of the overall conversation flow but personally I wouldn't use a bot like this if it only works for one particular class. If I could manage all of my assigned coursework easily enough for a bot like GritBot to be able to plug into it, I'd probably just set up cron reminders for myself and skip the whole ""bot interaction"" thing. That being said, I'm sure a lot of other people would appreciate a bot like this working for them.","This seems a bit ambitious for a 6-week chatbot project. I'd also deem it somewhat unnecessary - I can search Google Scholar myself for 10 to 20 papers faster than the one paper that GritBot found and the user agreed to open. Also, displaying the whole abstract in a chat interface is a bit overboard. I would just link the user to the 10 top results and leave it at that. Conversations should be short and to-the-point.","Why did you score a 9/10 if the feedback said ""I have given you 10/10 on your assignment""?

A bit ambitious to poke into the Piazza API and grab feedback and specific threads, though.",I'm pretty much fine with this one.,"I think GritBot's conversations are a bit wordy.

This one is a terrible idea! Having to get 10 messages every time you're interested in something stinks. And then getting the abstract in individual messages like that? Why would anyone think that would be helpful? If nothing else, it's just a glorified Let Me Google That For You bot. Anyone could find information faster just by googling it themselves rather than answering 1 - 10 a bunch of times.","Besides the obvious of saying they scored 9 out of 10 and then later the mentor saying they were given 10/10, I liked the robot in this conversation. A little less useful if the instructor isn't one to leave comments but perfect here.","lol, I liked that Carlos worked at a level 3 effort on this class. ;P",Make the survey shorter next time.

For example, the messages ""The fastest you provide feedback to your peers, the better..."" and ""Thus if you provide all peer reviews..."" and ""In contrast..."" are long and probably already known by the user by Week 7. It makes the bot feel 'spammy'. Otherwise, I love the concept, especially the scheduling. ","""Pick a topic"" should accept the topics themselves, not just the 1-10 index.  Also sending the top 10 articles as 10 separate messages (and no links until you get to the end of the workflow? -- takes too long) seems very spammy. Maybe top 3 at most would be interesting. Also, if this is use case is done weekly, how often does the content change?

It might be nice to opt-in to the planning section though, in this case it looks like the user already had time planned for assignments (Saturday and Sunday) so the bot didn't really help with that.","My initial thought was that this seems like the posts on Piazza where someone shares an interesting article. Generally, I regard those as noise. I appreciate that some folks don't feel the same though. After thinking about it more, if the articles the bot suggests are well curated, it could be a nice benefit during the written assignment phase of the course.","Good flow. Just my two cents, it would be nice to see the grade in the first message (I'll never answer ""No"" to the first prompt). That's the information I'm most interested in. Realistically, I probably wouldn't engage with the reflection portion, but I like the idea.","I like this flow, I think it's a nice idea to integrate posting on Piazza.

How are the reminders generated, inside the app? calendar appt? I wouldn't suggest providing notification after each feedback submission but rather after all is complete.
